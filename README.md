## Synopsis

This project was completed as a part of my coursework for the course CSCI 571: Web Technologies at the University of Southern California, Spring 2020 under Prof. Marco Papa.

## Why?

**Problem**: How in the world do you keep track of all hot:fire: news happening around? Way too many! It's like a Russian novel! Help! :astonished:

**Solution**: We stream the news you need and can add them to read-it-later list to read according to your convenience. We'll source, sort, summarize and quantify different news categories
