## Anything else?

Remember the rules!

It's _not_ about:

- how good your code is,
- how novel the idea is, or
- how useful the project is.

It _is_ about:


- **Learning**: GCP, CORS and auth are always tough!
- **OSS practices**: Plentiful commits, branches, PRs!
- **Approved tech**: Many projects integrated into one!
